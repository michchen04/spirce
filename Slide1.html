            <p>In order to figure out where to start, we had to do research. Firstly, 
            we looked for existing products that functions similarly to how we would 
            imagine our product to work and discovering how said product functions 
            and applying those principles to our own design. One of these products 
            included the flashlight crank. The flashlight crank utilizes a process 
            called electromagnetic induction to produce electricity. It does this by 
            rubbing the surface of a magnet against a wired coil. When this is done 
            it pulls electrons from the magnetic field, generating energy. </p>
            <center><img src="Images/emi.gif" alt="Gif of Electromagnetic Conduction"></center>
            <p>We decided 
            on using this process for our bike motor by attaching a chain from the 
            rotating bike wheel to a motor. We planned on utilizing this process for 
            our invention because of its simplicity and effectiveness. </p>
            <p>Afterwards, we 
            needed to make sure enough electricity being generated was enough. When 
            trying to determine this we used various websites; one of which being the 
            "OMNI Calculator" this site allowed us to calculate the amount of wattage
            generated from cycling. It used many averages such as the average US male
            and US female weight, average bicycle weight etc. After discovering our
            wattage output, about 45 watts. </p>
            <center><img src="Images/omni.JPG" alt="Picture of Omni Calculator"></center>
            <p>We moved onto modeling what our 
            prototype. We took inspiration from other devices that attempted to 
            complete what we were trying to do as a base and improving upon it. Though 
            currently our product generates enough energy, it is not consistent. We
            had to take into account inconsistent speeds and overworking the battery 
            over time. We needed to find a way to keep the electric current stable 
            without over stimulating the battery. </p>
            <center><img src="Images/motor.png" alt="Picture of Omni Calculator"></center>
            <p>We found that by transferring our
            electricity generated by the motor to a regulator we were able to keep 
            the electricity stable and discharge extra energy. This not only fixes 
            our problem but ensures that the life of the battery lasts longer.
