            <p>There were a few criterias we had to meet while brainstorming our innovation.
            We needed to fix an existing problem in the world, target a specific audience 
            or group of people who needed this problem fixed, and we needed to make a 
            new product or improve on an existing product.</p>
            <p>We began our brainstorming by listing different possible groups 
            that have fixable problems.
            These groups of people consisted of:
            Young Children,
            Teenagers,
            Young Adults,
            Adults,                      
            People in Developed Countries,
            People in Undeveloped Countries, and
            People with Disabilities
            </p>
            <p>We then thought of different topics, or themes. 
            These consisted of: Kinetic Energy, Thermal Energy, Electricity, 
            Apps, Websites, Robotics, Security, Sound Waves, and Human Convience</p>
            <p>We decided to use our own problems as inspiration and started 
            thinking of our pet peeves, problems in our lives, and activites that
            we do. One activity that really struck us was biking. Biking not only
            applies to us but to almsot every single categories listed above. 
            People of all ages and in all different places around the world bike.
            We thought, "How can we use the fact that tons of people bike to solve
            an existing problem?" We then looked through our topics and one seemed
            to really stand out, Electricity. That's when we decided to find a way 
            to produce energy with a bike, maybe through an attachment. This could
            help bring more electricity to underdeveloped countries and can be 
            convient to people in more developed countries, maybe to charge their
            phones or lights. </p>
            <p>However, with a quick google search, this idea has already been made.
            However, there are a lot of flaws and is pricey. We know that we can 
            make this attachment better and cheape. We are improving on an electricity
            producing attachment to a bike by changing the material, design and palcement.</p>
