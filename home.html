                Tens of millions of bikes are sold every year and there are tons of people
                who utilize this. Some bike to get to work or biking to deliver items is 
                their work, while other bike for fun or recreationally. Bikes are a vital 
                part of many people's lives and commonly use. So why don't we use bikes to
                benefit ourselves. Our idea is to create a decive you can attach to a bike 
                to produce electricity. You can use the energy from the wheel turning to 
                charge your lights or your phone. This idea has been made before but we 
                intend to make it better by changing the material, placement, and design.
