            Millions of people around the world bike daily, weather it be for 
            convenience or for sheer enjoyment. Many people have the constant 
            problem of running out of electricity on their phone or just have a 
            straight lack of electricity. 
            <p>
            One thing all these bikers have in common is how much energy 
            they are wasting. So much energy could be produced while biking, 
            it is a waste to not try and harvest it. This way people to bike to 
            work or bike to a nearby village or market would be producing energy 
            the whole way there. We decided to make it 
            portable to make it more convient to bring around because currently,
            bike chargers are all attached to the ground. We used other products
            for inspiration and implemented multiple mechanics from different 
            devices into our product.

            <p>We implemented our Computer Science Principles and Intro To
            Engineering and Design to create a model of our product and to create
            this website to advertise and explain what our product is about.</p>
