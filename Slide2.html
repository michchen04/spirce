            <p>As for the product analysis, we surveyed fifty people. All ranging
            from family members to friends. We explained our invention and had 
            them give their inputs. Overall, they all agreed that this is a useful
            and feasible idea. They liked how it can make renewable energy and 
            can be brought anywhere and can be used anywhere. We also told them 
            that this product was really effective, as it makes 45 watts an hour. 
            This tower over all solar portable chargers. </p>
            <p>However, there were also 
            some complaints. They critiqued the build quality, as it did not look 
            very appealing and seemed like a lot to put on a bike. They also 
            questioned the price of the product as well. Finally, they questioned 
            how this would be assembled. As for the build quality, we could not 
            think of a way to cover it. Anything that would cover it would interfere 
            with wheels or the biker's leg. It is hard to hide the chain and motor
            without it being an interference. The price took a little while to calculate,
            but after finding the materials online, we estimated the price to be
            around $100 to $150. This seems expensive, but after looking at other 
            alternatives for other chargers as good as ours, the $150 pales in 
            comparison to their prices. Finally, the assembly. This would definitely 
            take a while to assemble. The motor and battery would take a while to 
            attach. However, the chain would be easy to connect. </p>
