            <p>As for our product analysis, we surveyed twenty-six people. All 
            ranging from family members to friends. We explained our invention 
            and had them give their inputs. Overall, they all agreed that this 
            is a useful and feasible product. They liked how it can make 
            renewable energy and can be bought anywhere and can be used anywhere.
            Many liked how the energy being generated from the invention was 
            renewable and how the energy was being pulled from an everyday task.</p>

            <p>We explained that our product would be very efficient as it would 
            be generating around 45 watts per hour, which is the same amount as
            average solar battery banks. However, there were some complaints. 
            They critiqued the build quality, as it didnâ€™t look very appealing 
            and seemed like a lot to put on a bike. </p>

            <p>Though the motor and battery are placed in obscure areas of the bike, 
            we focused mainly around the efficiency of the product rather than aesthetics, 
            after testing various on where the motor and battery could possibly be placed, 
            our location would be the best without interfering with the mechanical parts
            nor pedaling of the biker. Additionally, the location of the parts would 
            cut down on unnecessary material cost as they are placed relatively close 
            to each other. They also questioned the price of the product. The price took a 
            little while to calculate, but after finding the materials online, we estimated 
            the price to be around $100 to $150. This seems expensive, but after looking at 
            other alternatives for other chargers as efficient as ours, the $150 pales in 
            comparison to their prices. As for marketability, majority of the people surveyed 
            said they would buy it. </p>

            <p>Finally, they questioned the assembly, or more specifically, how long it 
            would take to assemble. This would definitely take a while to assemble and 
            might be difficult. The motor and battery would take a while to attach. 
            However, the chain would be really easy to connect. </p>
